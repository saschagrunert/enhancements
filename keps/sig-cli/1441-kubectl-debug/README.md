## Summary

This proposal adds a command to `kubectl` to improve the user experience of
troubleshooting. Current `kubectl` commands such as `exec` and `port-forward`
allow troubleshooting at the container and network level. `kubectl debug`
extends these capabilities to include Kubernetes abstractions such as Pod, Node
and [Ephemeral Containers].

User journeys supported by the initial release of `kubectl debug` are:

1. Create an Ephemeral Container in a running Pod to attach debugging tools
   to a distroless container image. (See [*Pod Troubleshooting with Ephemeral
   Containers*](#pod-troubleshooting-with-ephemeral-debug-container))
2. Restart a pod with a modified `PodSpec`, to allow in-place troubleshooting
   using different container images or permissions. (See [Pod Troubleshooting by
   Copy](#pod-troubleshooting-by-copy))
3. Start and attach to a privileged container in the host namespace. (See [*Node
   Troubleshooting with Privileged Containers*](
   #node-troubleshooting-with-privileged-containers))

[Ephemeral Containers]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/277-ephemeral-containers/README.md

## Motivation

### Use Cases

#### Distroless Containers

Many developers of native Kubernetes applications wish to treat Kubernetes as an
execution platform for custom binaries produced by a build system. These users
can forgo the scripted OS install of traditional Dockerfiles and instead `COPY`
the output of their build system into a container image built `FROM scratch` or
a [distroless container image]. This confers several advantages:

1.  **Minimal images** lower operational burden and reduce attack vectors.
2.  **Immutable images** improve correctness and reliability.
3.  **Smaller image size** reduces resource usage and speeds deployments.

The disadvantage of using containers built `FROM scratch` is the lack of system
binaries provided by a Linux distro image makes it difficult to
troubleshoot running containers. Kubernetes should enable one to troubleshoot
pods regardless of the contents of the container images.

#### Kubernetes System Images

Kubernetes itself is migrating to [distroless for k8s system images] such as
`kube-apiserver` and `kube-dns`. This led to the creation of a [scratch
debugger] to copy debugging tools into the running container, but this script
has some downsides:

1. Since it's not possible to install the debugging tools using only Kubernetes,
   the script issues docker commands directly and so isn't portable to other
   runtimes.
2. The script requires broad administrative access to the node to run docker
   commands.
3. Installing tools into the running container requires modifying the image
   being debugged.

`kubectl debug` would replace the scratch debugger script with a method
idiomatic to Kubernetes.

#### Operations and Support

As Kubernetes gains in popularity, it's becoming the case that a person
troubleshooting an application is not necessarily the person who built it.
Operations staff and Support organizations want the ability to attach a "known
good" or automated debugging environment to a pod.

### Goals

Make available to users of Kubernetes a troubleshooting facility that:

1. works out of the box as a first-class feature of the platform.
2. does not depend on tools having already been included in container images.
3. does not require administrative access to the node. (Administrative access
   via the Kubernetes API is acceptable.)

New `kubectl` concepts increase cognitive burden for all users of Kubernetes.
This KEP seeks to minimize this burden by mirroring the existing `kubectl`
workflows where possible.

### Non-Goals

Ephemeral containers are supported on Windows, but it's not the recommended
debugging facility. The other troubleshooting workflows described here are
equally as useful to Windows containers. We will not attempt to create
separate debugging facilities for Windows containers.

[distroless for k8s system images]: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-release/20190316-rebase-images-to-distroless.md
[scratch debugger]: https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/contrib/tree/master/scratch-debugger

## Proposal

`kubectl debug` supports a number of debugging modes, described in the
following sections.

### Pod Troubleshooting with Ephemeral Debug Container

We will add a new command `kubectl debug` that will:

1. Construct a `v1.Container` for the debug container based on command line
   arguments. This will include an optional container for namespace targeting
   (described below).
2. Fetch the specified pod's existing ephemeral containers using
   `GetEphemeralContainers()` in the generated pod client.
3. Append the new debug container to the pod's ephemeral containers and call
   `UpdateEphemeralContainers()`.
4. Watch pod for updates to the debug container's `ContainerStatus` and
   automatically attach once the container is running. *(optional based on
   command line flag)*

We will attempt to make `kubectl debug` useful with a minimal of arguments
by using reasonable defaults where possible.

```
Examples:
  # Create an interactive debugging session in pod mypod and immediately attach to it.
  # (requires the EphemeralContainers feature to be enabled in the cluster)
  kubectl debug mypod -it --image=busybox

  # Create a debug container named debugger using a custom automated debugging image.
  # (requires the EphemeralContainers feature to be enabled in the cluster)
  kubectl debug --image=myproj/debug-tools -c debugger mypod
```

#### Debug Container Naming

Currently, there is no support for deleting or recreating ephemeral containers.
In cases where the user does not specify a name, `kubectl` should generate a
unique name and display it to the user.

#### Container Namespace Targeting

In order to see processes running in other containers in the pod, [Process
Namespace Sharing] should be enabled for the pod. In cases where process
namespace sharing isn't enabled for the pod, `kubectl` will set
`TargetContainer` in the `EphemeralContainer`. This will cause the ephemeral
container to be created in the namespaces of the target container in runtimes
that support container namespace targeting.

[Process Namespace Sharing]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/share-process-namespace

#### Interactive Troubleshooting and Automatic Attaching

Since the primary use case for `kubectl debug` is interactive troubleshooting,
`kubectl debug` supports automatically attaching to the ephemeral container
using the same conventions as `kubectl run`.

### Pod Troubleshooting by Copy

Pod troubleshooting via Ephemeral Container relies on an alpha feature which is
unlikely to be enabled on production clusters. In order to support these
clusters, and because it would be generally useful, we will support a mode of
Pod troubleshooting that behaves similar to Pod Troubleshooting with Ephemeral
Debug Container but operates instead on a copy of the target pod.

The following additional options will cause a copy of the target pod to be
created:

```
Options:
      --copy-to='': Create a copy of the target Pod with this name.
      --replace=false: When used with '--copy-to', delete the original Pod
      --same-node=false: When used with '--copy-to', schedule the copy of target Pod on the same node.
      --share-processes=true: When used with '--copy-to', enable process namespace sharing in the copy.
```

The modification `kubectl debug` makes to `Pod.Spec.Containers` depends on the
value of the `--container` flag. Unlike with debugging with ephemeral
containers, debugging by copy does not support generating a name for new
containers.

#### Creating a Debug Container by copy

If a user specifies a container name with `--container` that does not exist,
then the user is instructing `kubectl debug` to create a new Debug Container in
the Pod copy. In this case `--image` is the container image to use for the new
container.

```
Examples:
  # Create a debug container as a copy of the original Pod and attach to it
  kubectl debug mypod -it --container=debug --image=busybox --copy-to=my-debugger
```

#### Modify Application Image by Copy

If a user specifies a container name with `--container` that exists, then the
user is instructing `kubectl debug` to change the image for this one container
to the image specified in `--image`.

If a user does not specify a `--container`, then they are instructing `kubectl
debug` to change the image for one or more containers in the pod. In this case,
`--image` is the image mutation language defined by `kubectl set image`.

```
Examples:
  # Create a copy of mypod named my-debugger with my-container's image changed to busybox
  kubectl debug mypod --image=busybox --container=my-container --copy-to=my-debugger -- sleep 1d

  # Create a copy of mypod with the image of all container changed to busybox
  kubectl debug mypod --image=*=busybox --copy-to=my-debugger

  # Create a copy of mypod with the specified image changes
  kubectl debug mypod --image=main=busybox,sidecar=debian --copy-to=my-debugger
```

### Node Troubleshooting with Privileged Containers

When invoked with a node as a target, `kubectl debug` will create a new
pod with the following fields set:

* `nodeName: $target_node`
* `hostIPC: true`
* `hostNetwork: true`
* `hostPID: true`
* `restartPolicy: Never`

Additionally, the node's '/' will be mounted at `/host`.

```
Examples:
  # Create an interactive debugging session on a node and immediately attach to it.
  # The container will run in the host namespaces and the host's filesystem will be mounted at /host
  kubectl debug node/mynode -it --image=busybox
```

### User Stories

#### Operations

Alice runs a service "neato" that consists of a statically compiled Go binary
running in a minimal container image. One of its pods is suddenly having
trouble connecting to an internal service. Being in operations, Alice wants to
be able to inspect the running pod without restarting it, but she doesn't
necessarily need to enter the container itself. She wants to:

1.  Inspect the filesystem of target container
1.  Execute debugging utilities not included in the container image
1.  Initiate network requests from the pod network namespace

This is achieved by running a new "debug" container in the pod namespaces. Her
troubleshooting session might resemble:

```
% kubectl debug -it --image debian neato-5thn0 -- bash
root@debug-image:~# ps x
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 ?        Ss     0:00 /pause
   13 ?        Ss     0:00 bash
   26 ?        Ss+    0:00 /neato
  107 ?        R+     0:00 ps x
root@debug-image:~# cat /proc/26/root/etc/resolv.conf
search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local
nameserver 10.155.240.10
options ndots:5
root@debug-image:~# dig @10.155.240.10 neato.svc.cluster.local.

; <<>> DiG 9.9.5-9+deb8u6-Debian <<>> @10.155.240.10 neato.svc.cluster.local.
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
```

Alice discovers that the cluster's DNS service isn't responding.

#### Debugging

Bob is debugging a tricky issue that's difficult to reproduce. He can't
reproduce the issue with the debug build, so he attaches a debug container to
one of the pods exhibiting the problem:

```
% kubectl debug -it --image=gcr.io/neato/debugger neato-5x9k3 -- sh
Defaulting container name to debug.
/ # ps x
PID   USER     TIME   COMMAND
    1 root       0:00 /pause
   13 root       0:00 /neato
   26 root       0:00 sh
   32 root       0:00 ps x
/ # gdb -p 13
...
```

He discovers that he needs access to the actual container, which he can achieve
by installing busybox into the target container:

```
root@debug-image:~# cp /bin/busybox /proc/13/root
root@debug-image:~# nsenter -t 13 -m -u -p -n -r /busybox sh


BusyBox v1.22.1 (Debian 1:1.22.0-9+deb8u1) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

/ # ls -l /neato
-rwxr-xr-x    2 0        0           746888 May  4  2016 /neato
```

Note that running the commands referenced above requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and
`CAP_SYS_PTRACE`.

This scenario also requires process namespace sharing which is not available
on Windows.

#### Automation

Carol is a security engineer tasked with running security audits across all of
her company's running containers. Even though her company has no standard base
image, she's able to audit all containers using:

```
% for pod in $(kubectl get -o name pod); do
    kubectl debug --image gcr.io/neato/security-audit -p $pod /security-audit.sh
  done
```

#### Technical Support

Dan's team provides support for his company's multi-tenant cluster. He can
access the Kubernetes API (as a viewer) on behalf of the users he's supporting,
but he does not have administrative access to nodes or a say in how the
application image is constructed. When someone asks for help, Dan's first step
is to run his team's autodiagnose script:

```
% kubectl debug --image=k8s.gcr.io/autodiagnose nginx-pod-1234
```

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats

1.  There's an output stream race inherent to creating then attaching a
    container which causes output generated between the start and attach to go
    to the log rather than the client. This is not specific to Ephemeral
    Containers and exists because Kubernetes has no mechanism to attach a
    container prior to starting it. This larger issue will not be addressed by
    Ephemeral Containers, but Ephemeral Containers would benefit from future
    improvements or work arounds.

### Risks and Mitigations

1.  There are no guaranteed resources for ad-hoc troubleshooting. If
    troubleshooting causes a pod to exceed its resource limit it may be evicted.
    This risk can be removed once support for pod resizing has been implemented.

## Design Details

### Full `kubectl debug` Arguments

```
Debug cluster resources using interactive debugging containers.

 'debug' provides automation for common debugging tasks for cluster objects identified by resource and name. Pods will
be used by default if resource is not specified.

 The action taken by 'debug' varies depending on what resource is specified. Supported actions include:

  *  Workload: Create a copy of an existing pod with certain attributes changed, for example changing the image tag to a new version.
  *  Workload: Add an ephemeral container to an already running pod, for example to add debugging utilities without restarting the pod.
  *  Node: Create a new pod that runs in the node's host namespaces and can access the node's filesystem.

 Alpha disclaimer: command line flags may change

Examples:
  # Create an interactive debugging session in pod mypod and immediately attach to it.
  # (requires the EphemeralContainers feature to be enabled in the cluster)
  kubectl debug mypod -it --image=busybox

  # Create a debug container named debugger using a custom automated debugging image.
  # (requires the EphemeralContainers feature to be enabled in the cluster)
  kubectl debug --image=myproj/debug-tools -c debugger mypod

  # Create a debug container as a copy of the original Pod and attach to it
  kubectl debug mypod -it --image=busybox --copy-to=my-debugger

  # Create a copy of mypod named my-debugger with my-container's image changed to busybox
  kubectl debug mypod --image=busybox --container=my-container --copy-to=my-debugger -- sleep 1d

  # Create an interactive debugging session on a node and immediately attach to it.
  # The container will run in the host namespaces and the host's filesystem will be mounted at /host
  kubectl debug node/mynode -it --image=busybox

Options:
      --arguments-only=false: If specified, everything after -- will be passed to the new container as Args instead of
Command.
      --attach=false: If true, wait for the container to start running, and then attach as if 'kubectl attach ...' were
called.  Default false, unless '-i/--stdin' is set, in which case the default is true.
  -c, --container='': Container name to use for debug container.
      --copy-to='': Create a copy of the target Pod with this name.
      --env=[]: Environment variables to set in the container.
      --image='': Container image to use for debug container.
      --image-pull-policy='': The image pull policy for the container.
      --quiet=false: If true, suppress informational messages.
      --replace=false: When used with '--copy-to', delete the original Pod
      --same-node=false: When used with '--copy-to', schedule the copy of target Pod on the same node.
      --share-processes=true: When used with '--copy-to', enable process namespace sharing in the copy.
  -i, --stdin=false: Keep stdin open on the container(s) in the pod, even if nothing is attached.
      --target='': When debugging a pod, target processes in this container name.
  -t, --tty=false: Allocate a TTY for the debugging container.

Usage:
  kubectl debug (POD | KIND '/' NAME) --image=image [ -- COMMAND [args...] ]

Use "kubectl options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
```

### Test Plan

#### Alpha milestones

In addition to standard unit tests for `kubectl`, the `debug` command will be
released as a `kubectl alpha` subcommand, signaling users to expect instability.
During the alpha phase we will gather feedback from users that we expect will
improve the design of `debug` and identify the Critical User Journeys we should
test prior to Alpha -> Beta graduation.

#### Beta milestones

For Beta release, the following user journeys will have integration tests in the
`test/cmd` package:

  - [Pod Troubleshooting by Copy](#pod-troubleshooting-by-copy)
  - [Node Troubleshooting with Privileged Containers](#node-troubleshooting-with-privileged-containers)

Additionally we'll review unit tests to ensure they're complete before
graduation.

#### GA milestones

If the `EphemeralContainers` feature has reached beta, we will add an
integration test for [Pod Troubleshooting with Ephemeral Debug Container
](#pod-troubleshooting-with-ephemeral-debug-container).

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha -> Beta Graduation

- [x] A task on https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/ describes how to troubleshoot
  a running pod using Ephemeral Containers.
- [ ] A survey sent to early adopters doesn't reveal any major shortcomings.
- [x] Test plan is amended to address the most common user journeys.
- [ ] Test plan Beta milestones reached.

#### Beta -> GA Graduation

- [ ] Test plan GA milestones reached
- [ ] User feedback gathered over 2 release cycles.
- [ ] 3 external articles suggest using `kubectl debug`

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

This functionality is contained entirely within `kubectl` and shares its
strategy. No configuration changes are required.

### Version Skew Strategy

`kubectl debug` makes use the following recent features:

- Process namespace sharing (alpha: 1.10, beta: 1.12, GA: 1.17)
- Ephemeral containers (alpha: 1.16)

Not all functionality in `kubectl debug` requires these features. If an
invocation requires a feature that is not enabled in the cluster, the api server
will reject the pod creation request.

Special consideration is given to the Ephemeral Containers feature since this
feature will not be enabled on most clusters while it is in alpha. The `kubectl
debug -h` displays `(requires the EphemeralContainers feature to be enabled in
the cluster)` for examples that require ephemeral containers.

Since ephemeral containers use a dedicated subresource, the api server will
return a 404 when the feature is disabled. When this happens for a target that
exists, kubectl prints `ephemeral containers are disabled for this cluster`.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

* **How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?**
  - [ ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
    - Feature gate name:
    - Components depending on the feature gate:
  - [x] Other
    - Describe the mechanism: **A new command in `kubectl alpha`**
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
      plane? **no**
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
      of a node? **no**

* **Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?**

  It's a new command so there's no default behavior in kubectl. If a user
  has installed a plugin named "debug", that plugin will be masked by the
  new `kubectl debug` command. This is a known issue with kubectl plugins,
  and it's being addressed separately by sig-cli, likely by detecting this
  condition and printing a warning.

* **Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back
  the enablement)?**

  Yes, you could roll back to a previous release of `kubectl` and any pods
  created by `kubectl debug` would still be accessible via other `kubectl`
  commands.

* **What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?**

  You can create pods again

* **Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?**
  
  No, because it cannot be disabled or enabled in a single release

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

* **How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?**

  The feature is encapsulated entirely within the kubectl binary, so rollout is
  an atomic client binary update. Pods created by the new command may be
  manipulated by any version of `kubectl`, so there are no version dependencies.

* **What specific metrics should inform a rollback?**

  There's no need for a rollback unless `kubectl` is not working at all.

* **Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?**

  No, there's no need.

* **Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, 
fields of API types, flags, etc.?**

  The command will move from `kubectl alpha debug` to `kubectl debug`. If the
  user has a kubectl plugin named "debug", it will be masked.

### Monitoring Requirements

* **How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?**

  Since it uses the standard core API, there's no way to determine whether a
  pod or ephemeral container was created by `kubectl debug` or manually by a
  user.

* **What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine 
the health of the service?**
  - [ ] Metrics
    - Metric name:
    - [Optional] Aggregation method:
    - Components exposing the metric:
  - [x] Other (treat as last resort)
    - Details: There's no running service.

* **What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?**

  There's no running service.

* **Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability 
of this feature?**

  It would be easy to add a "created by kubectl debug" annotation to a newly
  created pod, but we don't want to preemptively add features that are only
  theoretically useful.

### Dependencies

* **Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?**

  No.

### Scalability

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?**
  Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods):

    GET/CREATE/PATCH pods, GET nodes

  - estimated throughput:

    Negligible, because it's human initiated. There will be 1 read + 1 mutate
    per `kubectl debug` command. At that point there's a new pod for the system
    to manage.

  - originating component(s):

    kubectl

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?**

  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud 
provider?**

  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of 
the existing API objects?**

  One new Pod or EphemeralContainer when initiated by a user.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any 
operations covered by [existing SLIs/SLOs]?**

  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of 
resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?**

  Creating a pod will use more resources, but only when initiated by a user.

### Troubleshooting

* **How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?**

  `kubectl` is not resilient to API server unavailability.

* **What are other known failure modes?**

  This command creates objects using the core API. Writing a Playbook of how to
  respond when the system is not creating core Kinds is outside the scope of
  this KEP.

* **What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?**

  Definitely stop running `kubectl debug`.
